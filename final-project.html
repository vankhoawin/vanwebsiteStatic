            <p>The user interviews helped me get perspectives on technology, and a ballpark estimate on what answers I would get from different types of people. The people I interviewed came from all walks of life, and had a variety of answers to the tech questions I had asked them, specifically about Instagram.</p>

            <p>A competitor analysis is a report done on products that are similar or share similar characteristics as yours. I did my analyses on portfolios I found online on a website that had a curated list of extraordinary portfolios. These portfolios oozed with uniqueness, such as the one that was built like a shell terminal which you could even type into. Portfolios like these stand out to the audience and show technical skill and an eye for design.</p>

            <p>The feature value matrix helped me determine which features I should implement that would be the most valuable acording to user value, business value, and developer effort. I made a list of 8 things that I thought would improve the website, and ultimately ended up working on AJAX loading photography albums.</p>

            <p>The feature prioritization helped me visually determine what features I should include in my next cycle. Writing down features in the feature value matrix were only numbers, but these graphs really help lock in my priorities.</p>

            <p>User stories are important because it helps me determine who my audience is and how I should be implementing features to help target the biggest subset of it. It also helps me determine which epics are the most important to target based on my users.</p>

            <p>A cognitive walkthrough is a usability evaluation method where the evaluators work through a series of tasks and ask a set of questions from the user's perspective. The point is to find how learnable/accessible your product is to the user. For the most part, my evaluators did not have trouble navigating through my website because I've kept the navigation quite simple and are respectively labeled.</p>

            <a href="https://usabilityhub.com/tests/f2ffa6d8881b/results/b21b125b2d1" target="_blank">Question Test</a>
            <p>One of the tests I did was the question test. I chose this one because I could specifically ask questions about the page and the user would give me a personalized answer based on his experience of the website. This was the more negative of the tests, and frankly the more rewarding one. I got a lot of feedback about what was bad about my website, which I took as constructive criticism and fixed.</p>

            <a href="https://usabilityhub.com/tests/c1e2f59c8a0f/results/9a3ed8d18096" target="_blank">Click Test</a>
            <p>The other test I did was the click test. This basically let me ask a question about the website/navigation and the user would hover his mouse over the correct area. I was able to ensure that my navigation was clear and information was in the correct places.</p>

        <h1>Summary of Findings</h1>
        <div class="separator">
          <p>From my findings, I learned that what may look good to just me, the developer, may have very different outlooks from other perspectives. The usability tests in specific helped tremendously in that regard; they were able to pull my attention to fixing design choices that negatively affected my portfolio. I also found that I should be targeting the biggest subset of my audience as possible. Yes, I could be working on one feature for my website, but is it the one that most needs my attention? The best way to figure it out, I've found, is to create the feature value matrix.</p>
          <p>Some challenges I faced was the lack of a CSS framework. I have been used to designing using Bootstrap or Foundation, so making my own media queries and CSS was a tougher challenge than I thought. On the bright side, I've learned a lot about media queries that I didn't know before, such as media queries that only target print-only pages and so on.</p>
        </div>
        <h1>Incorporation of Findings</h1>
        <div class="separator">
          <p>From my user tests I found out a lot of things I could've improved on in my portfolio. For example, some users pointed out that the transparency behind my main contain was too light and the writing was thus illegible. I also found out that text was touching my profile image on some media queries, which I hadn't noticed before since I develop on a large, widescreen monitor. It literally took different perspectivies to figure out that I was missing padding on the image to separate it from the text. </p>
          <p>Another part that helped me was the user stories. I found out that users didn't like that my Photography page, which uses AJAX to pull in albums from my Flickr, redirected them to the full Flickr site when they wanted to view images inside albums. Now, with their advice, I've made it so that my portfolio will send out another AJAX request to grab all of the album's pictures without redirecting. This helps the cohesiveness of my website and keeps users always on my page, unless they were explicitly visiting me on another social media application.</p>
