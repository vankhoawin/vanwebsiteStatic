        <p>Hi there, I'm Van. I've always enjoyed exploring my creative side. This list includes but is not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Photography</li>
          <li>Playing piano</li>
          <li>Producing electronic music</li>
          <li>Programming</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Physically exploring is another big hobby of mine. I studied abroad at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland during my junior year and had the chance to meet new people and see some of Europe's wondrous landscapes. I've been to Europe and Asia multiple times and can't wait for the next time I go back. I also enjoy urban exploration when I have the chance to (see my Salton Sea photography album); it's always exciting to find remnants of the structures people of the past used, lived, and worked in.</p>
        <p>I also play League of Legends. If any diamond+ players are reading this, please add me (badboy365) and carry my sorry ass out of bronze. I play support, but based on my scores support the opposing team more often than my own.</p>
